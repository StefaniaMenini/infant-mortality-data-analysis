# infant-mortality-data-analysis
Final academic team project for *"Data Science: Python"*, a curricular course attended throughout the fall semester of my second master's degree in *Business Analytics* at Hult International Business School. 
My team and I have been tasked with leading analysis on *Northern Sub Saharan Africa infant mortality* utilizing *World Bank* data. By conducting our research we had the opportunity to:
- Conduct an exploratory data analysis using Python
- Formulate a strategy for missing values and identifying potential outliers
- Develop a Jupyter Notebook on our process and findings (with ample use of markdown)
